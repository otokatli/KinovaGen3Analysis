# KinovaGen3Analysis

This code presents the kinematic and dynamic analysis of Kinova Gen3 robot. The
robot is assumed to be mounted on a desk where *zero* configuration is
vertical.

The code generates

    - Python
    - C++
    - Julia

function for the robot's

    - forward kinematics
    - Jacobian
    - Time derivative of the Jacobian
    - Mass matrix
    - Coriolis term multiplied with joint velocities
    - Gravity term
